# Settled In

With this application, we hope to address the perpetual lack of resources which exists in refugee settlements.

The MODIS API and VIIRS datasets can inform organizations and individuals who want to help.

Settled In will analyze a given settlement's environment and conditions so that partnering organizations can make

informed decisions, work alongside camps to reduce waste, and provide relevant resources for these communities.

Our dream is that this data analysis tool humanizes the experienced of displaced people.

## Next Steps

* consume the UNHCR API to find settlement camp locations (API was temporarily unavailable as of 10-20-2018)

* implement logic to handle MODIS & VIIRS data

* convert app styling into a responsive layout for various screen sizes

* implement data visualizations using a tool like processing or D3
